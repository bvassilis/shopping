SHOPPING BASKET

Scenario

A ground breaking Broadband company has decided to roll out Broadband add-ons by
geographic area in the United Kingdom. A software engineering team, developing the online
store, is working on the story below.

Offer Broadband Add-ons:
As the head of broadband sales I want to let customers who live in an add-on area know that there
are add-ons available for the broadband product in their basket so that they can add the add-on to
their basket before checkout

A “Broadband add-on” is an enhancement to a customer’s existing Broadband product. For
example BB_ EXTRA_CAPACITY_ADD_ON enhances the Broadband ‘Lite’ product.

The Broadband company has partnered with a third party that provides a service that checks
the Add-on availability for a given postcode (either all add-ons are available for that postcode
or none are).

Included in the exercise pack

The following files are included in the gr.hellasdirect.onlinestore package:
• Basket.java
• BroadbandAddOnService.java
And the following files are included in the com.acme.serviceavailability package:
• AvailabilityChecker.java
• TechnicalFailureException.java

Instructions

Try and spend no more than two to three hours on this problem.
You are required to provide an implementation of the BroadbandAddOnService interface -
a simple service containing a single method.
Any of the supplied files in the gr.hellasdirect.onlinestore package may be
changed as you see fit, including the BroadbandAddOnService interface itself.
You may choose any means of accepting input and producing output, including the use of
a test harness.

• CONNECT
• LITE

available on the LITE product

The third party availability service returns the following String values:
Value Description

• SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE - add-ons are unavailable for the given post code
